## Introduction

`Vitrail` is a text generator using context-free grammars, inspired by projects like [Tracery](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery), or [Grammy](https://github.com/AlmasB/grammy).

It can be used on the spot by providing a grammar as a JSON file, and following the default syntax, and can be used as a library.

## Features

- Read grammar from JSON file
- Shared variables, available through all symbol expansions
- Customisable grammar syntax/operators (when used as a library)
- Potential for custom modifiers (when used as a library)
